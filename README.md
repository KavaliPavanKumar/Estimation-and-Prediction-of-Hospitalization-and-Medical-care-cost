### Project Demo Link :  https://kavalipavankumar.github.io/Estimation-and-Prediction-of-Hospitalization-and-Medical-care-cost/

Medical costs are one of the most common recurring expenses in a person's life. Based on different research studies, BMI, ageing, smoking, and other factors are all related to greater personal medical care costs. The estimates of the expenditures of health care related to obesity are needed to help create cost-effective obesity prevention strategies. Obesity prevention at a Young age is a top concern in global health, clinical practice, and public health.
